## Codebase

Here's the coarse architecture for each application in the monorepo:

- **Docker Compose:** We use Docker Compose to set up everything necessary for the end-to-end tests to run against. By default, it'll fetch and run pre-built Docker images hosted on AWS ECR. 
- **Dockerfile:** The Dockerfile will set up the testing dependencies, e.g. headless browsers and, by default, know how to run the tests against localhost.

### Technologies

Here is a list of all the big technologies used in the applications (you shouldn't need to know anything about these to run the tests):

- Django: Python web framework
- Postgres: Data storage
- etc...

The browser tests use these technologies:

- Nightwatch: Automated testing framework powered by Node.js and using W3C Webdriver
- Protractor: An end-to-end test framework for Angular and AngularJS applications
